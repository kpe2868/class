      I have only made one website and it was for ITD 110, Web Design I. While making this website, I used Notepad, https://www.w3schools.com/, and my second monitor to make the 
      process easier. Once I finished the class, I learned about Atom and have been using it since. That said, I plan to experiment with other tools.
