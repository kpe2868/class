      ITD 110 - Web Design I did not cover responsive web design, so I would like to learn about responsive web design in ITD 210 - Web Design II. 
      I would also like to solidy the knowledge I learned in ITD 110. Considering our book is <i>Reponsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS3</i> by Ben Frain, 
      I'm confident I will achieve my goals.
