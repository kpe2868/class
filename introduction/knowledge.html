      ITD 110 - Web Design I was my first experience creating a website, so I learned quite a bit from the class. ITD 110 focused on the basics of CSS3 and HTML5 
      and the importance of making your website accessible to everyone. ITD 110 gave me the knowledge to make a basic website but it didn't go beyond the basics, so
      I'm still lacking a lot of web design knowledge.
